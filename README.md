[sprocs](https://sprocs.com) wormhole is a **serverless local tunnel** that uses API Gateway (HTTP and WebSocket), Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 to
proxy web requests such as webhooks or API requests to your local environment for testing/development purposes.

- **Easy to deploy**: click-through deployment wizard via AWS Amplify
- **Gain visibility and control over your local proxy traffic**: keep your development requests within your own cloud infrastructure, know who has access
- **Multiple hosts/clients**: setup unlimited custom subdomains for multiple clients (or use single API Gateway endpoint)
- **HTTP auth support**: setup HTTP auth to protect your public endpoint

Some use cases:
- Developing mobile apps with local APIs
- Developing with webhooks from third party services (Twilio, GitHub, etc.)
- Client demos

## Getting Started

[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/sprocs/wormhole)

Follow the Amplify wizard to create a new app environment and **after deployment
is complete**:

1. Grab your new `API Gateway (http)` endpoint that was created by navigating to `Services -> API Gateway -> APIs -> wormholeApi-ENV (Wormhole Public API)` in the AWS console and copying the `Invoke URL` (your API Gateway endpoint).
2. Run the wormhole client locally with your newly setup API Gateway endpoint (or custom subdomain if setup, see [Custom subdomains](#custom-subdomains)) as the first argument and local http port to proxy to as the second argument:

```
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://my-api-gateway-id.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000 --max-ws-size 100000
```

See [sprocs/docs Setup](https://github.com/sprocs/docs/blob/main/setup.md) for more info and options regarding deploying sprocs (such as targeting specific branches).

## wormhole client options

```
# Listen on a port (recommended options)
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://APIGATEWAYID.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000 --max-ws-size 100000

# Listen on a port with debug enabled
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://APIGATEWAYID.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000 -d

# Listen on a port if HTTP auth setup
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://cdunn:supersecret@APIGATEWAYID.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000

# Listen on a port for a custom hostname
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://wormhole1.mydomain.com 3000

# Force listen on a host if another client is already connected (disconnects the other client)
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://APIGATEWAYID.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000 --force

# List connections
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole connections
```

### wormhole client listen options

```

```

## AWS profile/credentials for wormhole client

The wormhole client uses [aws-sdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/) and [awscred](https://github.com/mhart/awscred#awscredloadcredentialsandregionoptions-cb) to load your AWS credentials and sign requests (sigv4) to access your wormhole resources on AWS (WebSocket API, wormhole S3 bucket, etc).

The wormhole client AWS profile/credentials will need the IAM permissions as specified in
[amplify/backend/policies/wormholeClientPolicy/wormholeClientPolicy-cloudformation-template.json](https://github.com/sprocs/wormhole/blob/main/amplify/backend/policies/wormholeClientPolicy/wormholeClientPolicy-cloudformation-template.json)

A group with this IAM policy is created for each deployed environment as
`wormholeClientPolicy-${env}` in your IAM Groups. You can simply add or
create a user to the group to give it appropriate IAM permissions to act as a
wormhole client.

Once complete, you can specify the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY/AWS_REGION
or AWS_PROFILE while running the wormhole client.

Standard environment variables or AWS profiles are the best way to provide
credentials to your client. AWS Credentials can be provided to the client in standard ways:

```
# via profiles:
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole ...

# via keys:
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=2Yd4z... npx @sprocs/wormhole ...

# or specified in your shell config .bashrc/.zshrc/etc...
```

## Custom subdomains

You can setup as many subdomains as you'd like using your own domain. Each
hostname can only be served by a single client so multiple hostnames via
subdomain is the easiest way to have multiple clients/users have their own local
tunnel.

You can setup subdomains by:
1. Navigate in AWS console to `API Gateway -> Custom domain names`
2. Click `Create`
3. Type the name of the subdomain/domain you'd like to create, example:
   `wormhole-1.mydomainhere.com`.
4. Create the `Custom domain name` with default settings but select your ACM
   certificate (wildcard `*.mydomainhere.com` or subdomain only `wormhole-1.mydomainhere.com` depending on your setup). If you do not have an ACM certificate, you can `Request a certificate` under the AWS `Certificate Manager` service. After validating your domain, a new certificate will be issued allowing you to serve SSL traffic over your subdomain.
5. After creating the `Custom domain name`, select it and then select the tab
   `API mappings` and then click `Configure API mappings`
6. Select the `wormholeApi-${env}` API gateway and leave the default settings
   (Stage: `$default`, Path: *empty*)
7. Select `Save`
8. Select the tab `Configuration` and copy the `API Gateway domain name` (ex: `xyz123.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`) and add this as a `CNAME` for the subdomain specified in your DNS settings for your domain (example: add a CNAME for `wormhole-1.mydomainhere.com` to `xyz123.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` in Route53 or wherever you manage the DNS for your domain)
9. After DNS propagation, you should now be able to use the subdomain to connect
   to your wormhole in place of your underlying API gateway endpoint.
10. Repeat this process for as many subdomains as you would like.

## Architecture

</p>

## AWS Services Used

* API Gateway (HTTP)
* API Gateway (WebSockets)
* DynamoDB
* Lambda
* S3

## Tips

* When running JS apps that serve assets via a build system (webpack based/Next.js/Create React
App/etc), running the compiled/built/optimized app is much more stable than
trying to serve the development build from localhost. The assets often have
`no-store` cache-control headers and the unoptimized large file sizes that can lead
to websocket rate limits trying to send megabytes of data over websockets (with a 32kb max frame size) instead of using S3 to proxy.
For example, running a `yarn build`/`yarn start` versus `yarn dev` for Next.js apps can often fix asset serving failures.

* Use the `--max-ws-size/-m` listen option to limit the maximum response size that is
attempted over websockets. Too many websocket packets in a short duration can
trigger rate limits and reduce reliability and timeout on API gateway. S3, while
slightly slower, is a more reliable option for response payloads > 100kb.

* Wormhole is designed for lightweight/basic web app usage such as dev API requests
for a mobile app or receiving webhooks from a third-party like Twilio.

## HTTP Auth

Configuration options are loaded by [AWS System Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html).

To enable HTTP auth, set the following Parameters (replacing the `env` with your
own respective AWS Amplify environment ie. `devx`)

`/sprocs/wormhole/ENV/BASIC_AUTH_USER`
`/sprocs/wormhole/ENV/BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

* To add a new parameter, navigate to `Services -> Systems Manager -> Parameter Store -> Create Parameter`
* Specify the path above as the `Name` and value as the `Value`
* You may need to wait until lambda goes cold before new SSM params are loaded

## AWS billing

Wormhole relies on serverless resources within your own AWS account once deployed and will generate an associated AWS bill at standard AWS rates based on your usage. **Your AWS bill is your own responsibility** (likely small for normal use but do your own diligence).

Wormhole utilizes [API Gateway (HTTP and WebSockets)](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/), [DynamoDB On-Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing), and [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing). See AWS pricing for more information.

Wormhole sets up the following AWS tags on resources it creates `sprocs_app = wormhole` and `sprocs_env = AMPLIFY_ENV_HERE` for billing reporting purposes.

Setup [AWS Budget](#aws-budget-setup) notifications to monitor for unexpected serverless costs.

By using only serverless AWS resources, you only pay for what you use and not for
idle time. Comparable SaaS offerings are almost always magnitudes more
costly.

See [sprocs/docs Pricing: AWS Pricing](https://github.com/sprocs/docs/blob/main/pricing.md#aws-pricing) for more info.

## AWS Budget Setup

See [sprocs/docs Setup: AWS Budget Setup](https://github.com/sprocs/docs/blob/main/setup.md#aws-budget-setup)

## Security

sprocs creates AWS IAM roles/profiles during AWS Amplify deployment (via CloudFormation) with only necessary permissions to resources used (and often created) by the app and app environment (as an example, the wormhole lambda functions have access to the wormhole S3 bucket and DynamoDB tables/etc.). You can review these permissions in the CloudFormation templates (located in `amplify/backend/../..-cloudformation-template.json`).

For added security/visibility, we recommend [creating an AWS subaccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) via `AWS Organizations` to isolate your sprocs.

Potential security vulnerabilities can be reported directly to us at `security@sprocs.com`.

See [sprocs/docs Security](https://github.com/sprocs/docs/blob/main/security.md)
for more info.
