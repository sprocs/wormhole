wormhole is a **serverless local tunnel** that uses API Gateway (HTTP and WebSocket), Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 to
proxy web requests such as webhooks or API requests to your local environment for testing/development purposes.

- **Easy-to-deploy**: one-click deployment with AWS Amplify
- **Gain visibility and control over your local proxy traffic**: keep your development requests within your own cloud infrastructure, know who has access
- **Multiple hosts/clients**: setup unlimited custom subdomains for multiple clients (or use single API Gateway endpoint)
- **HTTP auth support**: setup HTTP auth to protect your public endpoint

Some use cases:
- Developing mobile apps with local APIs
- Developing with webhooks from third party services (Twilio, GitHub, etc.)
- Client demos

## Getting Started

[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/sprocs/wormhole)

After deployment, run the client locally with your newly setup HTTP API Gateway
endpoint (or custom subdomain) as the first argument and local http port to proxy to as the second argument:

```
AWS_PROFILE=my-aws-profile npx @sprocs/wormhole listen https://my-api-gateway-id.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com 3000
```

## AWS profile/credentials

The wormhole client uses [aws-sdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/) and [awscred](https://github.com/mhart/awscred#awscredloadcredentialsandregionoptions-cb) to load your AWS credentials and provide signed requests to access your wormhole resources on AWS.

The AWS user/profile/role will need the following IAM permissions:
```

```

Standard environment variables or AWS profiles are the best way to provide
credentials to your client.

## Custom subdomains

## Architecture

## AWS pricing

Wormhole will likely generate a small AWS bill (negligible for normal use but do your own diligence). Wormhole utilizes [API Gateway (HTTP and WebSockets)](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/), [DynamoDB On-Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing), and [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing). See AWS pricing for more information.

Wormhole sets up the following AWS tags on resources it creates `sprocs_app = wormhole` and `sprocs_env = AMPLIFY_ENV_HERE` for billing reporting purposes.

Setup billing notifications to monitor for unexpected serverless costs.
